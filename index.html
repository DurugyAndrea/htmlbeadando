            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Game Award for Game of the Year is an award presented annually by the Game Awards. It is
                given to a video
                game judged to deliver the best experience across creative and technical fields. The award is
                traditionally
                accepted by the game's directors or studio executives. The process begins with over 100 video game
                publications and websites, which collectively name six games as nominees. After the nominees are
                selected,
                the winner is chosen by a combined vote between the jury (90%) and public voting (10%).</p>

            <h2>Voting</h2>
            <p>The Game Awards has an advisory committee which includes representatives from hardware manufacturers
                Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and AMD, along with several game publishers. This committee selects game news
                organizations that are able to nominate and subsequently vote on the video games in several categories.
                The advisory committee otherwise does not participate in the nomination or voting process. During the
                nomination round, each of the news outlets provides a list of games in several categories; games for the
                esports-related categories are chosen by a specific subset of these outlets. The committee compiles the
                nominations and selects the most-nominated games for voting by these same outlets. As of 2024, there are
                over one hundred media publications around the world that were chosen as
                juries.</p>
            <p>Generally, only games released before a specific date in November are eligible for being nominated in the
                year's awards. As the jury must make their nominations in the weeks prior to this date, this may leave
                some anticipated games that are scheduled for release just before that date to be underrepresented in
                the nominations, since the jury must go by pre-release review copies and not the final version. Any
                games releasing after the November deadline (which varies every year) are eligible for the next year's
                ceremony. Game expansions, seasonal content, downloadable content, remakes, and remasters are also
                eligible across all award categories.</p>

            <h2>Winner</h2>
            <p>The Game Award for Game of the Year is given to a video game judged to deliver the best experience across
                creative and technical fields. It is presented as the final award of the ceremony and is widely
                considered its most prestigious honor. Since 2017, the announcement of the winner has been
                preceded by a medley performance of the scores of each nominee by the Game Awards Orchestra, conducted
                by Lorne Balfe. The category was expanded from five to six nominees in 2018.</p>
